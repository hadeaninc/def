Spark Risk Monte Carlo
==============

This is a fork of the original [Cloudera Monte Carlo VaR example code](https://github.com/sryza/montecarlorisk).

Histogram generation is disabled and timing statements added.

Scripts used to run on Amazon EMR have been provided as run-1, run-2, and run-3.

Logs from these runs for different numbers of trials can be found in the logs folder.
